# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Basically anything that's live and shipping.

The main things we're concerned about are:

* Any spooky GitHub Actions that don't behave in an expected way.
* Anything related to linking our theme to a `git submodule` checkout.

Both of these always kind of creep @todb out, but hey, everyone's doing it.

Pretty much everything else in this repo is normal static GitHub pages webpages, any bug you spot in the website or the CDN or anything like that is better reported to GitHub proper, but we're happy to take a look at it!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The funniest way to report a bug is to drop it at the next [AHA! meeting](https://takeonme.org/meetings/) and get @todb to reserve a CVE and GCVE identifier for it on the spot.

The less funny, but more neighborly mechanism, is to just report it directly to @todb over the internet like a normal person. Please avoid opening a public issue. Methods to get in touch with @todb are myriad and listed on his GitHub profile.
