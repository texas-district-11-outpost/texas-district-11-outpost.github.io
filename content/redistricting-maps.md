# About the 2025 Texas redistricting

In the summer of 2025, the Texas legislature undertook a special session to redraw the map of Texas's US Congressional districts. You can read a summary of this action on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Texas_redistricting).

The result was intended to ensure through [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) that the national Republican party would gain five additional seats in the US House of Representatives through cracking and packing map-drawing techniques. This is not a conspiracy theory, nor even a controversial opinion; it was the stated goal of the Governor of Texas, at the direction of the President of the United States.

As a result, many Democratic-favored districts were subsumed into large geographical areas with Republican-voting majorities when the new maps were passed by the Texas legislature and signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott.

## North Austin (TX-37) affected

North Austin was mostly in TX-37, which covered north and west Austin. It is now gerrymandered into three rural Texas districts, as illustrated below. TX11.us is primarily concerned with the newly formed TX-11, though we share concerns with our close neighbors who now find themselves in TX-37 and TX-10.

### District 11 (was District 37)

Rattan Creek Park is noted as a reference, in the extreme southeastern corner. TX-11 now stretches from Pecan Street in Pflugerville to far west Texas, beyond Midland and Odessa.

### District 10 (was District 37)

Yett Creek Neightborhood Park near Riata Vista is noted as a reference, on the western side. The new TX-10 stretches mostly eastward through College Station and to Corrigan.

### District 17 (was District 37)
