More content to come. Here's a blurb about the [redistricting maps](/redistricting-maps) that was the genesis for this website and the organizng around it.

Feel free to fork this on [Github](https://github.com/texas-district-11-outpost/texas-district-11-outpost.github.io) and study the README and open any issues there. Surely there are bugs/typos.
