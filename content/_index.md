Hello, and behold, the [TX11.us](https://tx11.us) website! It's very much in progress.

We have so much more content to come! In the meantime, here's a blurb about the [redistricting maps](/redistricting-maps) that was the genesis for this website and the organizng around it, and a [signup](/signup) form to let us know you're interested in helping out!

Feel free to fork this on [Github](https://github.com/texas-district-11-outpost/texas-district-11-outpost.github.io) and study the README and open any issues there. Surely there are bugs/typos.
