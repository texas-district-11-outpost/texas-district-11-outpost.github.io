# BREAKINGER NEWS

The stay on the new district maps was short-lived. On November 21, 2025, Justice Samuel Alito granted Texas' request to stay the court's ruling. So, for now, we're back to the new 2025 map. It's impossible to say with certainty what will happen next; it's possible the filing deadlines for the March primaries will be extended, or the stay will simply keep the new maps in effect for the purposes of filing.

# BREAKING NEWS

On November 18, 2025, a three-judge panel determined that Texas's new U.S. Congressional Districts are most likely in violation of the law, and a temporary injunction was entered. That means that, as of right now, you are still going to be voting in your old (current) congressional district.

However, the state of Texas has indicated it will appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Depending on how quickly the Supreme Court acts, this injunction could be stayed, which would put you back into your "new" district.

Yes, this is confusing! Stay tuned here for updates, and read the [Texas Tribune article](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/18/texas-redistricting-ruling-lawsuit-el-paso-court-2026-midterms/) for more details.

# WHO ARE WE?

We are a group of Rattan Creek neighbors who want to raise awareness that our part of the neighborhood has been gerrymandered into what will become the new Texas U.S. Congressional District 11. [Sign up](/signup) here to keep informed!

# WHAT ARE WE DOING?

You may have seen the "Welcome to Odessa" logo around the neighborhood:

This is our tongue-in-cheek response to the fact that the new District 11 will range from Pflugerville, through our neighborhood, all the way out to Odessa. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in our area is aware of their soon-to-be new congressional district so we can ensure that our voices are heard. The current District 11 is represented by Republican Congressman August Pfluger, out of San Angelo. We expect him to run again in 2026, when the new district maps will go into effect.

# WHEN IS THIS HAPPENING?

The new district maps will go into effect for the 2026 elections. Both the Republican and the Democratic primaries are scheduled to be held on March 3, 2026, with the general election scheduled for November 3, 2026. There is currently a lawsuit pending that could prevent this from happening and keep us in our old district for the 2026 election, but we expect the new maps to eventually go into effect. We will keep you posted on the status of the lawsuit.

# WHERE IS MY NEW DISTRICT?

Here is some info about the [redistricting maps](/redistricting-maps) that was the genesis for this website and the organizng around it. You can also go to [this page](https://dvr.capitol.texas.gov/Congress/73/PLANC2308), zoom in, and see the boundaries of each new district within your neighborhood.

# WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

President Donald Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have stated that the reason for the mid-decade redistricting is to increase the number of Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Rattan Creek and the surrounding neighborhoods have tended to vote Democratic in the past few elections. By subsuming these neighborhoods into a solidly Republican district that stretches to far West Texas, those voters who vote Democratic will presumably be outnumbered, thereby reducing the effect of their votes.

# HOW CAN WE STOP THIS?

To be blunt, there is not much we can do to stop this. There is ongoing litigation right now, but we are preparing as if this is a sure thing. Our goal is to ensure every member of the soon-to-be new District 11 is aware of this and that they get out and vote in 2026! If you'd like to be a part of this, you can use this [signup](/signup) form to let us know you're interested in helping out.
