# LITIGATION NEWS

On December 4, 2025, the United States Supreme Court has effectively reinstated the new district maps after a brief return to the pre-2025 maps by temporarily staying the Texas District Court's ruling that the new maps are likely in violation of the law.

While these new district borders may change in the coming months, these are the maps we have to live with for the upcoming 2026 election.

# WHO ARE WE?

We are a group of Rattan Creek neighbors who want to raise awareness that our part of the neighborhood has been gerrymandered into what will become the new Texas U.S. Congressional District 11. [Sign up](/signup) here to keep informed!

# WHAT ARE WE DOING?

You may have seen the "Welcome to Odessa" logo around the neighborhood:

This is our tongue-in-cheek response to the fact that the new District 11 will range from Pflugerville, through our neighborhood, all the way out to Odessa. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in our area is aware of their soon-to-be new congressional district so we can ensure that our voices are heard. The current District 11 is represented by Republican Congressman August Pfluger, out of San Angelo. He is running unopposed in the primary as the Republican candidate. He will face off against one of two Democrat candidates - Claire Reynolds or Pedro "Pete" Ruiz. 

# WHEN IS THIS HAPPENING?

The new district maps will go into effect for the 2026 elections. Both the Republican and the Democratic primaries are scheduled to be held on March 3, 2026, with the general election scheduled for November 3, 2026. There is currently a lawsuit pending that could prevent this from happening and keep us in our old district for the 2026 election, but we expect the new maps to eventually go into effect. We will keep you posted on the status of the lawsuit.

# WHERE IS MY NEW DISTRICT?

Here is some info about the [redistricting maps](/redistricting-maps) that was the genesis for this website and the organizing around it. You can also go to [this page](https://dvr.capitol.texas.gov/Congress/73/PLANC2308), zoom in, and see the boundaries of each new district within your neighborhood.

We also have a fun Google map you can search directly for your address to see if you're in, or out, of TX-11. Either click below to scroll around and see what's up, or use our handy [geolocater](/geolocate) to look up the saddress you're interested in.

# WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

President Donald Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have stated that the reason for the mid-decade redistricting is to increase the number of Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Rattan Creek and the surrounding neighborhoods have tended to vote Democratic in the past few elections. By subsuming these neighborhoods into a solidly Republican district that stretches to far West Texas, those voters who vote Democratic will presumably be outnumbered, thereby reducing the effect of their votes.

# WAIT, IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?

In the United States, yes. Legislators in power can draw district boundaries to improve their re-election odds, provided they don't explicitly base those lines on certain prohibited factors. This makes America an outlier among modern democracies, most of which restrict or forbid partisan control of redistricting.

In this case, however, the motivating factor **was** racial discrimination. A Texas district court found exactly that, but the Supreme Court set aside those findings when it reviewed and ultimately overturned the lower court's ruling.
