# WHO ARE WE?

WHO ARE WE?
We are a group of Austin Area residents who want to raise awareness that our part of the neighborhood has been gerrymandered into what will become the new Texas U.S. Congressional District 11. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in our area is aware of their soon-to-be new congressional district so we can ensure that our voices are heard. [Sign up](/signup) here to keep informed!

# WHAT ARE WE DOING?

You may have seen the "Welcome to Odessa" logo around the neighborhood. 

This is our tongue-in-cheek response to the fact that the new District 11 will range from Pflugerville all the way out to Odessa. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in our area is aware of their soon-to-be new congressional district so we can ensure that our voices are heard. The current District 11 is represented by Republican Congressman August Pfluger, out of San Angelo. He is running unopposed in the primary as the Republican candidate. He will face off against one of two Democrat candidates - Claire Reynolds or Pedro "Pete" Ruiz. 

# WHERE IS MY NEW DISTRICT?

Here is some info about the [redistricting maps](/redistricting-maps) that was the genesis for this website and the organizing around it. You can also go to [this page](https://dvr.capitol.texas.gov/Congress/73/PLANC2308), zoom in, and see the boundaries of each new district within your neighborhood.

We also have a fun Google map you can search directly for your address to see if you're in, or out, of TX-11. Either click below to scroll around and see what's up, or use our handy [geolocater](/geolocate) to look up the saddress you're interested in.

# WHEN IS THIS HAPPENING?

The new district maps will go into effect for the 2026 elections. Both the Republican and the Democratic primaries are March 3, 2026, and the general election is November 3, 2026. The current District 11 is represented by Republican Congressman August Pfluger, out of San Angelo. He is running unopposed in the primary as the Republican candidate. He will face off against one of two Democrat candidates - Claire Reynolds or Pedro “Pete” Ruiz.


# WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

President Donald Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have stated that the mid-decade redistricting is to increase the number of Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Rattan Creek and the surrounding neighborhoods have tended to vote Democratic in the past few elections. By subsuming these neighborhoods into a solidly Republican district that stretches to far West Texas, those Democratic votes will presumably be outnumbered.

# WAIT, IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?

In the United States, yes. Legislators in power can draw district boundaries to improve their re-election odds, provided they don’t base those lines on prohibited factors. This makes America an outlier among modern democracies, most of which restrict or forbid partisan control of redistricting.

However, many feel that the motivating factor in this case was racial discrimination. A Texas District court found exactly that, but the Supreme Court set aside that ruling and overturned the lower court’s decision. For more information on the court battles, see this

# HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED?

Our goal is to make every member of the new District 11 aware of these changes, and encourage them to get out and vote in 2026!
