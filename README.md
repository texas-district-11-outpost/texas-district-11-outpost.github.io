# texas-district-11-outpost.github.io

A website for District 11 Outpost.

Very in progress at the moment.

## Things to keep in mind

* The base docs for GitHub Pages + Hugo is [here](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/).
* The name of the repo must match the organization name, as stated in the [GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).
* This is based largely off my experience with AHA!'s website, [takeonme.org](takeonme.org), which is really hosted at https://github.com/austinHackers/austinhackers.github.io with an A NAME pointing to GH Pages in the normal way.
	* You don't need a whole Go installation to use Hugo -- on a Mac, `brew install hugo` is all you need.
* You need a theme to do anything. Check out [this handy guide](https://dev.to/daleymottley/a-practical-guide-to-installing-a-hugo-theme-53be).
	* For testing I went with the very popular [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and their pretty stellar [documentation](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation) but I'm not super married to it.
